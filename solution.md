## Solution 

### Approach & Analysis

Random walks are rather silly. It's probably better to control the number of loops that happen, if only to morph things into more of a linear search (more predictable),

### Optimization Strategy

##### First implementation: Naive Figure-8
Really dumb, this is just sticking the top node in the middle
